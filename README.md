Installation
------------
You can install MLStats running setup.py script:

    # python setup.py install

If you don't have root privileges, use the `--prefix` option to indicate 
the directory where `mlstats` will be installed. For more details, take a 
look at the help of the installer:

    $ python setup.py install --help

You are ready to use `mlstats`.


Running mlstats
---------------

More options, and a more detailed info about the options, can be
learnt by running `mlstats --help`

The backend postgres requires the database already exists. The creation
of tables must be done manually. There is a SQL script with the schema
in `db/data_model_pg.sql` that can be used for this purpose.
